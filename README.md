Task 5 is about analyzing a company’s social media campaign performance. In simple words, you have to check how well different marketing campaigns did by looking at three things: engagement (likes, comments, shares), reach (how many people saw the campaign), and ROI (return on investment – profit compared to money spent). The main goal is to figure out which campaign worked the best and then give suggestions on what the company should do in future campaigns.
